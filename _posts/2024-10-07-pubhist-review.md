This issue of The Public Historian from November 2023 is organized around the theme of digital archives. In addition to exhibition and book reviews, the issue features five “reports from the field,” three of which directly relate to digital archives, while the other two detail instances of public historian work. Overall, the issue demonstrates the growing significance of technology in the daily practice of public historians and the benefits digital approaches bring to developing more responsive, representative, and accessible histories among the public.

The first article, “Slow Disasters and Adaptive Archiving: COVID-19 and the Rolling-Response Model,” details the creation of a digital archive project led by Arizona State University to document individual experiences of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Dubbed “Journal of the Plague Year: A COVID-19 Archive,” the project originally aimed to document student experiences of a single disrupted semester, but changed scope as the pandemic evolved into subsequent stages to collect stories from multiple locales and demographics. In doing so, they moved from a “rapid-response model,” covering the immediate response to an event, to a “rolling-response model,” coined by the authors, that spans six months or more and enables historians to “engage in a constant feedback loop” that can fill silences in the record, respond to discursive challenges, and more accurately reflect less discrete and definable events, like pandemics.

The second article, “Increasing Access to American Indian Off-Reservation Boarding School Archives: Sherman Indian Museum Digital Project,” documents a more straightforward digital archive project, in which University of California-Riverside built on a trusted relationship with the Sherman Indian Museum to digitize their collections, fund equipment upgrades, and increase the accessibility of their catalog to anyone interested in learning about the checkered history of native boarding schools. The key difference with a standard digital archive project is a move away from values of content ownership and open access to greater sensitivity towards indigenous cultural artifacts as specified by the Protocols for Native American Archival Materials (PNAAM). Following this protocol, UC-R successfully advocated to the proper organizations for updates to archiving software that have made digital archives more culturally inclusive.

The third article, “History, Historical Culture, and 1821: Creating a Digital Archive of Public History in the Twenty-First Century,” portrays the creation of the 1821 Greek Revolution Observatory, a digital project commemorating the bicentennial of the Greek Revolution. The authors involved in the project aimed at helping the public effectively engage with the “historical culture” of the various groups that use the Revolution in discourses about identify formation. Accordingly, the authors used the digital project to reflect viewpoints of academic historians, national and local institutions, artists and the Internet to bring into conversation with each other the ways in which Greeks have used the past across history to define themselves and respond to new challenges.

The fourth and fifth articles depart from the digital archive theme to show historians engaging with the public in new ways. In “We and Bobby Lee: Public Historians and the Fight to Remove Confederate Memorials”, the authors use their expertise and access to academic material to provide input over the 2021 campaign to rename Robert E. Lee Middle School in San Marcos, Texas. While admitting their status as locals and “white males” helped them state their case to the school board, I appreciated how effective producing historical facts targeting common narratives and sharing how certain historiographical perspectives were weaponized in certain political moments were to convincing the proper authorities and producing positive change. In “Busy Being Born: A Brief History of the Museum of Pop Culture”, the author describes the creation of the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle, Washington, arguing that the singular vision of Paul Allen as founder allowed the museum to set an example for non-traditional museums of the future and intervene in cultural discourse in ways more collectively-funded projects could not. Written by a former employee of Paul Allen’s Vulcan Foundation and engaging in typical hagiographic discourse around tech “visionaries,” this article felt below the standards of an academic article and, against its best attempts, showed the museum to be plagued by a lack of unity, denigration of countercultural stakeholders, and funding challenges.
