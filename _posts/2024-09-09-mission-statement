As public historians, we have a responsibility to best reflect the interests of the public, of our clients, and of our colleagues in our work according to the highest possible ethical standards of our profession. The public solicits our services to ensure the utmost care and consideration is given to those matters that strike at the heart of their identities, and as such, I pledge to maintain an empathy-first approach that centers the intentions and desires of each client in every project I take on, while integrating the present state of historical scholarship and technique as each project demands to the best of my ability.  As a working public historian, I pledge to view each project as an opportunity to conduct original research, extend and enrich the scholarship where relevant, and help my colleagues and peers meet their own standards for excellence. Most importantly, I pledge to consider the perspectives of all relevant stakeholders across all cultural perspectives with a conscious commitment to justice and to remain in open and constant dialogue with the latest concerns and expectations from across all voices in our society whenever the moment demands.
